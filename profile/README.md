# Repositories

## Clients

Here are clients being maintained under Revolt's organisation, though not all of them are necessarily maintained by the core team and instead are community projects (you can also find more [third-party clients here](https://github.com/revoltchat/awesome-revolt?tab=readme-ov-file#-third-party-clients)).

> [!NOTE]
> revoltchat/frontend is the next-generation Revolt client, [more details here](https://revolt.chat/posts/refreshing-revolt-web)
